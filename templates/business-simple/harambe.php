            <p>It was only one day after his 17th birthday. 
                Harambe was killed right after a 3 year old child fell into his habitat in Cincinnati Zoo. 
                Although Harambe did not do any harm to the boy and carried him to a safer place, zoo officials were agreed upon killing Harambe.
                A single gunshot was fired.
                Maybe it was the right decision, however he should not have been put in a cage in the first place.
                Animals should be free, and so are the softwares.
                <p>As long as he is remembered, he will not really die at all.</p>
